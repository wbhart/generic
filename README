This is an experimental flint2 generics module for generic ring computations.

It's features so far are:

* flat arrays of structs as the underlying representation of polynomials, etc.

* no wrapping of basic flint types (fmpz, etc.) required, the flint functions are called directly

* function pointers instead of case statements for dispatch

The design is experimental. It may become useless for objects with context objects.
